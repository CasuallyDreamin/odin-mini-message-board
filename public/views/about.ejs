    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>casuallydreamin</strong>, a junior full-stack developer with a passion for web development, game dev, and creative problem solving.</p>
    
    <p>I love exploring the web stack end-to-end, building projects that challenge me to think both technically and creatively. Whether it’s front-end interfaces, back-end logic, or database design, I enjoy getting my hands dirty and learning by doing.</p>
    
    <p>Outside coding, I’m into rock music, cats, and tinkering with game development. I also enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks that push my skills forward.</p>
    
    <p>You can check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/casuallydreamin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, where I post a mix of web apps, small games, and experimental projects.</p>
    
    <p>I’m always looking to collaborate, learn, and grow, so feel free to reach out!</p>
